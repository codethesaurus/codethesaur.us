## [codethesaur.us](http://codethesaur.us/)
Website that will compare language features side by side.

## Why would you want this?
Good question. If there's an aspect of a language you don't know, you can compare a languages you know with a language you do. It's a good way to quickly learn a new language, or use it as a quick reference to remember things by.
