            "low_level_language": "Language provides minimal abstraction from the hardware architecture of the computer",

            "compiled_language": "Language is translated into machine code or an intermediate form by a compiler before execution",

            "first_generation": "Language consists of binary code directly understood and executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU) and represent the lowest level of programming abstraction",
            "second_generation": "Language uses mnemonic codes and symbols to represent machine-level instructions, providing a more human-readable way to program and interact with a computer's hardware.",
            "third_generation": "High-level programming languages designed for general-purpose software development, offering a higher level of abstraction and greater ease of use compared to low-level languages like assembly.",
            "fourth_generation": "High-level programming languages designed for specific applications or domains, often using natural language-like syntax and focusing on rapid application development."
